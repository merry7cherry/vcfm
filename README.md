# [ICML 2025] Implementation of ``VC-FM: Variationally-Coupled Flow Matching''
This repository now houses the implementation of **VC-FM: Variationally-Coupled Flow Matching**, our Flow Matching method that combines EDM/EDM2 backbones with a variational coupling network trained via the straight-trajectory objective inspired by Rectified Flow.

## Requirements
This code uses Weights & Biases, and assumes that you have your wandb key in a file named `wandb_config.py` in a variable named `key=your_wandb_key`.
This code uses the following libraries:
```angular2html
pytorch 
torchvision 
torchaudio 
pytorch-cuda
lightning
torchmetrics[image]
scipy 
scikit-learn 
matplotlib 
wandb
hydra-core
POT
pyspng
```
You can check `requirements.txt` for the exact packases used in our experiments.
## Training
We provide example commands for training VC-FM with the new Flow Matching objectives. Batch size is specified per device.

### CIFAR-10 with EDM backbone
```bash
python main.py \
    project=vcfm_cifar \
    dataset=cifar10 \
    dataset.num_workers=16 \
    dataset.batch_size=256 \
    model=vcfm \
    network=edm \
    model.straightness_weight=1.0 \
    model.kl_weight=1.0
```

### CIFAR-10 with EDM2 backbone and pretrained initialization
```bash
python main.py \
    project=vcfm_cifar_edm2 \
    dataset=cifar10 \
    dataset.num_workers=16 \
    dataset.batch_size=128 \
    model=vcfm \
    network=edm2 \
    network.reload_url='https://nvlabs-fi-cdn.nvidia.com/edm2/posthoc-reconstructions/edm2-img64-s-1073741-0.075.pkl' \
    model.straightness_weight=0.5 \
    model.kl_weight=0.5
```

### FFHQ 64Ã—64
Follow the dataset preparation instructions from [https://github.com/NVlabs/edm](https://github.com/NVlabs/edm). Then run:
```bash
python main.py \
    project=vcfm_ffhq \
    dataset=ffhq \
    dataset.data_dir='your_data_dir' \
    dataset.batch_size=64 \
    model=vcfm \
    network=edm2 \
    model.class_conditional=False \
    model.straightness_weight=1.0 \
    model.kl_weight=0.5
```
